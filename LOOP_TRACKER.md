# Uchqun Refinement Loop — Master Tracker

**Loop order (strict):** 1. Backend → 2. Government → 3. Admin → 4. Reception → 5. Teacher → 6. Parent → 7. Database

**Each portal runs through 8 steps:** Understand → Audit → Plan-Cleanup → Confirm-Clean → Research-Gaps → Build-Cleanup → Plan-Features → Implement-Features → Final-Verify

**Status legend:** ⬜ Not started · 🟡 In progress · ✅ Closed (with evidence) · ⛔ Blocked

## Rules (read before every step)

1. Before starting ANY step, read this entire tracker. If the previous portal has any step that is not ✅, stop and report which one is incomplete. Never jump ahead.
2. A step is ✅ only when the deliverable file for that step exists, is complete, and has been honestly self-verified — not when "mostly done."
3. Honesty over speed. If something is broken, say so. If you guessed, say "I guessed here." No fabrication.
4. Read actual code. Do not infer from filenames or rely on previous audit markdown files. Every claim must cite file:line from the current state.
5. Update the tracker at the END of each step with: status, commit SHA, and the deliverable file path.
6. If you encounter ambiguity that needs a product decision, mark the step 🟡, document the question in `LOOP_QUESTIONS.md`, and stop.

## Step deliverables (file per portal)

- S0 → `audits/{portal}/00-understanding.md`
- S1 → `audits/{portal}/01-audit.md`
- S2 → `audits/{portal}/02-cleanup-plan.md`
- S3 → `audits/{portal}/03-cleanup-verification.md`
- S4 → `audits/{portal}/04-gap-research.md`
- S5 → `audits/{portal}/05-cleanup-execution.md`
- S6 → `audits/{portal}/06-feature-plan.md`
- S7 → `audits/{portal}/07-feature-execution.md`
- S8 → `audits/{portal}/08-final-verification.md`

Where `{portal}` ∈ { backend, government, admin, reception, teacher, parent, database }.
